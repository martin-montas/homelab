This is the siem that i use for my home lab.

## Configuration

You should be able to run the whole Configuration with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts master.yaml
```

Make sure to edit all the values that are surrounded by a {{ }}. make sure to replace them
in a file and call it vars.yaml
